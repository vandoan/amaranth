				<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <span style="font-size:1.4em;">Like with most things,</span> to get better at them, you'll need to put in the time. But not only that, you have to be effective. Make sure to be well rested and have little or no distractions. Turn that TV off. The music, too! Your brain can only take in one thing at a time, scientifically proven. Multitasking will just slow you down, so focus and be disciplined.  
				<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You can do it!

				<h1> &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Memorizing</h1>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <span style="font-size:1.4em;">Focus</span> on your weaknesses, not on your strength. Review what you already know once in a while, but focus most of your time  on what's hard. With time, you'll get it, and it'll become easier, so be efficient and effective with your time and build on your weaknesses, not strengths.

				<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <span style="font-size:1.4em;">Use them!</span> It's the use of letters, ideas or association to help you remember. Connect ideas to visuals. For example, if you have an image of a  petunia flower, try to connect that with a person with the same name. 
				<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

				<h1>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grit</h1>
				<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <span style="font-size:1.4em;">Don't give up.</span> Perfect practice makes perfect. The more you learn, the easier it'll get, but if you don't know as much, then life is going to be a lot harder. 
				<br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
				With anything, it takes practice, time, and discipline. Push yourself and after a while, learning about the world is pretty fun. You just have to get over the hump, but it takes a bit of hard work at first. Just remember, in the end, it's worth it!
